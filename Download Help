<!--

  1. Download the Project you would like to view from any of my Repositories.
  
  2. After downloading the Project of your choice. Extract the files with any extraction tool of your 
     choice and extract the files to your desktop. (Dont worry, once your done you can delete these files)

  3. MAKE SURE NOT TO ALTER THE DIRECTORY OF THE PROJECT! I have made the directory for you :)
  
  4. Once all of the files are visible on your Desktop, Click on the "index.html" file to visit the main file. If you do not see the styling of the 
     page then that means the directory was altered or your did not completely extract all the files.
     
  * This process will go for all of my current and future projects from now on! Easy as pie.
